In this project, I wrote a Python script named “data_extraction_M1.py” to process survey answer files. The first function reads a text file and extracts 100 answers, one for each question, by checking which option has an "x". The second function saves the answer list into a new file. I made sure the format is correct and added error checking for missing answers. This program helps convert messy text survey data into clean numerical data. Through this project, I practiced file reading, loops, and basic error handling in Python. It was a simple but meaningful task for me.
